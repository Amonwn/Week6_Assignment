### Request the answer to the question "Damascus is a"
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "Complete the following prefix"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Damascus is a"}
  ],
  n=10,
  max_tokens=20
)

### Print all 10 completions:
for i in range(10):
    st.write(response.choices[i].message.content)
  #print(response.choices[i].message.content) >> can't print here on sreamlit because there is no console, so we have to use st.write (found on streamlit documentation)
